-------------------------------------

## Overview

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of consumer behavior and product performance in an online cosmetics store, using data collected from October 2019 to February 2020. Each section outlines the objectives of the analysis, includes the SQL query used, and discusses how the results can be utilized along with associated usage. 

The analyses are categorized based on their objectives and the insights they provide. The insights gained from these analyses can drive strategic decision-making in marketing, sales, inventory management, and customer relationship management.

#### a. Objective
This report presents an in-depth analysis of consumer behavior and product performance in the cosmetics e-commerce, utilizing the [**eCommerce Events History in Cosmetics Shop**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-cosmetics-shop) dataset from **Kaggle**. The this files contains behavior data for 5 months **(Oct 2019 â€“ Feb 2020)** from a medium cosmetics online store, and are focus to provide insights for marketing and sales strategies, with an emphasis on *Business Intelligence* (BI) analytics.

#### b. Dataset
The complete dataset contains user event records, including product views, additions to cart, removals, and purchases. Each row in the file represents an event. All events are related to products and users. Each event is like many-to-many relation between products and users.

The downloadable dataset comprises five ".csv" files, each one with *9 columns* and related to a specific month, as mentioned, spanning from *October 2019 to January 2020.*

* The *table description* follows this structure and organization:

| **Property**     | **Description**                                             | **Type**  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| ``event_time``   | Time when event happened at (in UTC).                       | *time*    |
| ``event_type``   | Four kinds of event: view, cart, purchase, remove from cart | *string*  |
| ``product_id``   | ID of a product.                                            | *integer* |
| ``category_id``  | Product's category ID.                                      | *integer* |
| ``category_code``| Product's category taxonomy, code name (can be missing).    | *string*  |
| ``brand``        | Downcased string of brand name (can be missing).            | *string*  |
| ``price``        | Float price of a product. Present.                          | *float*   |
| ``user_id``      | Permanent user ID.                                          | *integer* |
| ``user_session`` | Temporary user's session ID. Changed after pauses.          | *string*  |

After downloading all the data from Kaggle, a data engineering stage was set up for analysis. The data was then transferred to a **Google Cloud Storage** bucket in Lakehouse, which was created specifically for this challenge. Subsequently, this dataset underwent extensive manipulation and transformation within a **BigQuery Studio** project, aptly named *Technical Challenge Autoforce*.

- ***Update 27.12:*** In a new phase of the *Technical Challenge*, to fill in missing information about the category and types of products in this dataset, we were asked to cross-reference product identifiers with the [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com) to obtain data about products and their respective categories. An application was developed in ``Node.js`` in the GCP environment, using **Google Cloud Function** to retrieve the dataset from the endpoint [products.json](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json) and convert it into CSV format.

Using **Google Cloud** tools and servers is the best option because it combines the resources of a *data lake* and a *data warehouse* into a single platform for storing, processing, and analyzing structured and unstructured data. This integration facilitates efficient storage, processing, and analysis of diverse datasets, encompassing both structured and unstructured data forms. Moreover, **Google Cloud's** seamless interoperability with **Looker Studio** significantly enhances its utility, enabling the creation of sophisticated, insightful dashboards essential for the visualization and interpretation of critical business intelligence.

#### c. Methodology

To conduct the analyses, such as **Business Intelligence Analysis**, as mentioned earlier, the following steps were required:

1. Setting up a secure data storage environment (*data lake*) for the Tables.
2. Uploading the 5 tables stored in the data lake through the *Technical Challenge Autoforce* project to be utilized and managed by the ``dataset_cs_ecommerce`` data warehouse in **BigQuery**.
3. Selecting and querying data using standard SQL language, making use of BigQuery's robust analytics engine to extract actionable insights, thus aligning with the goals of the technical challenge.
4. Utilize the **Google Colab** tool to access this dataset and conduct a more comprehensive descriptive analysis. This enabled not only *exploratory analysis* of the provided dataset, but also the identification of *trends*, *patterns* and the generation of initial *business insights*.

Therefore, SQL was as used for initial queries and Python for more complex analyses and some first data visualizations.

* Additional information on data engineering can be found in the documentation located in the ``1.data_engineering`` subdirectory of this [**Technical Challange project**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b7ixGTK3662_itDunzJlhohf8L5zQkal?usp=sharing).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Python for Powerful Descriptions

#### **Descriptive Analysis** 

Enhanced analytical depth and precision of your dataset was eminently achieved. We could encapsulate and elucidate various facets of our data, encompassing the most frequently viewed, added to cart, or purchased products, the zenith of shopping activities, the mean pricing of products, and the prevalent brands.

Given the intricate nature and complexity of the dataset, we had opted to undertake a specialized descriptive analysis focusing on consumer behavior and product performance within the cosmetics e-commerce sector. This analysis was facilitated through **Google Colab**, utilizing the robustness of *Python* and its extensive range of libraries. This approach enabled us to harness the full potential of the data, thereby deriving meaningful insights and strategic business intelligence.

- ***Update 27.12:*** For the next phase of the *Technical Challenge*, a random correlation of product identifiers was performed between the datasets, establishing a mapping between the ``id`` of the new **Makeup API** set and the ``product_id`` of the **eCommerce Events History in Cosmetics Shop** set. This resulted in a random correspondence between the identifiers, meaning each ``id`` in the **Makeup API** set will be linked to a random ``product_id`` in the **eCommerce Events History in Cosmetics Shop** set.

#### **Location of Analysis:**

* The files ``.ipynb`` and ``.pdf`` containing these analyses are located in the ``2.data_analysis`` subdirectory of this Project. Alternatively, the **Google Colab** notebook can be accessed directly via this [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GpEYc7mxzPASi1rQ6UENZj3OUtIpQF9E?usp=drive_link) here.

### Market Analysis Categories with SQL Queries Using a New Dataset

As previously mentioned and thoroughly explored in **Google Colab**, once the new ``products_data_makeup`` table is created in the **BigQuery** project, we can utilize SQL queries to retrieve the results of the analyses conducted thus far.

To carry out an approach similar to that carried out in **Google Colab** with the creation of a dataframe containing the cross-information of the two datasets directly in **BigQuery**, using SQL, it is necessary to follow basically the same steps, but adapted to *BigQuery's SQL syntax*.

**Steps to the Approach:**

1. **Random Selection of IDs:** First, a set of ``product_ids`` is randomly selected from the ``all_events_2019_to_2020`` dataset, ensuring that the number of selected ``IDs`` matches the number of rows in the ``product_data_makeup`` dataset.

2. **Temporary Table Creation:** Next, you create a temporary table in **BigQuery** that would map each id from the ``product_data_makeup`` dataset to a random ``product_id`` from the ``all_events_2019_to_2020`` dataset.

3. **Joining Tables:** Finally, you would join (``JOIN``) the two tables using the ``IDs`` mapped in the temporary table, resulting in a combined table.

```SQL
-- Step 1: Random selection of IDs
WITH random_ids AS (
    SELECT ARRAY_AGG(product_id ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_data_makeup)) AS ids
    FROM all_events_2019_to_2020
),
-- Step 2: Creating a temporary table with mapping
mapping_table AS (
    SELECT makeup_id, ids[OFFSET(row_number - 1)] AS mapped_product_id
    FROM (
        SELECT id AS makeup_id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS row_number
        FROM product_data_makeup
    ), random_ids
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(random_ids.ids) AS ids
)
-- Step 3: Joining the tables
SELECT m.*, n.*
FROM mapping_table
JOIN product_data_makeup m ON m.id = mapping_table.makeup_id
JOIN all_events_2019_to_2020 n ON n.product_id = mapping_table.mapped_product_id;
```

These are the same ways of querying data made in Colab with Python, but translated into SQL. Each of these following queries **provides specific insights** that **are instrumental in strategic decision-making** in areas such as marketing, sales, inventory management, and product development.

#### 1. Product and Category Analysis

**a. Distribution of Number of Purchases by Makeup Category:**

**Objective:** To identify the most popular makeup categories based on the number of purchases.

```sql
SELECT m.category, COUNT(*) AS number_of_purchases
FROM all_events_2019_to_2020 n
JOIN mapping_table map ON n.product_id = map.mapped_product_id
JOIN product_data_makeup m ON map.makeup_id = m.id
WHERE n.event_type = 'purchase'
GROUP BY m.category
ORDER BY number_of_purchases DESC;
```
**Usage:** This query is useful for understanding consumer preferences and demand within different makeup categories. It can help in inventory management, marketing strategy formulation, and product development.

**b. Number of Unique Categories per Brand:**

**Objective:** To find out how diverse each brand's product range is in terms of different makeup categories.
```SQL
SELECT m.category, COUNT(*) AS number_of_purchases
FROM all_events_2019_to_2020 n
JOIN mapping_table map ON n.product_id = map.mapped_product_id
JOIN product_data_makeup m ON map.makeup_id = m.id
WHERE n.event_type = 'purchase'
GROUP BY m.category
ORDER BY number_of_purchases DESC;
```
**Usage:** This query aids in assessing the product range diversity of each brand. It's valuable for market positioning analysis, competitive analysis, and for brands to identify potential areas for product line expansion.

#### 2. Pricing and Brand Analysis

**a. Average Price per Brand:**

**Objective:** To calculate the average price of products for each makeup brand.
```SQL
SELECT brand, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM product_data_makeup
GROUP BY brand
ORDER BY average_price DESC;
```
**Usage:** The query is crucial for pricing strategy, understanding brand positioning in the market (premium vs budget brands), and for comparative price analysis across competitors.

**b. Total Orders per Brand:**

**Objective:** To determine the total number of orders (purchases) for each brand.
```SQL
SELECT m.brand, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM all_events_2019_to_2020 n
JOIN mapping_table map ON n.product_id = map.mapped_product_id
JOIN product_data_makeup m ON map.makeup_id = m.id
WHERE n.event_type = 'purchase'
GROUP BY m.brand
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```
**Usage:** This query helps in identifying the most popular brands in terms of sales volume. It's essential for sales analysis, forecasting, and determining marketing and sales strategies for high-performing brands.

### 3. Consumer Behavior Analysis

**a. Distribution of Makeup Categories Across Different Event Types:**

**Objective:** To analyze how different makeup categories are interacted with across various event types (cart, purchase, remove from cart, view).
```SQL
SELECT m.category, n.event_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM all_events_2019_to_2020 n
JOIN mapping_table map ON n.product_id = map.mapped_product_id
JOIN product_data_makeup m ON map.makeup_id = m.id
GROUP BY m.category, n.event_type;
```
**Usage:** This query is useful for understanding consumer engagement and behavior with different product categories. Insights from this analysis can guide marketing campaigns, user experience improvements on e-commerce platforms, and inventory management.

**b. Distribution of Makeup Brands Across Different Event Types:**

**Objective:** To explore the interaction of users with different makeup brands across various event types.
```SQL
SELECT m.brand, n.event_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM all_events_2019_to_2020 n
JOIN mapping_table map ON n.product_id = map.mapped_product_id
JOIN product_data_makeup m ON map.makeup_id = m.id
GROUP BY m.brand, n.event_type;
```
**Usage:** The query provides insights into brand popularity and consumer interaction patterns. Itâ€™s valuable for brand performance analysis, developing targeted marketing strategies, and enhancing customer engagement techniques.
